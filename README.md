# MemeMachine
Designed to make it easy to save, index, and send pictures and videos. Designed mostly for the use of handling internet memes.

**Getting Started**<br/>
Tested with Java 1.8 on a Windows 10 machine.
Can only run on Windows.
Once running, all you have to do is set the local path under the Settings tab for where the pictures and videos will be saved to.
The program saves every entry to that local path, and handles everything else programmatically.

**What can it do?**<br/>
- Save pictures and videos by dragging and dropping them from the computer into the window.
- Save pictures by dragging and dropping them from Chrome into the window.
- Index entries with tags.
- Search for entries using tags.
- Create, delete, and edit tags, while no entry is selected. (Ctrl + Left Click a selected entry to deselect)
- Autocomplete functionality to help you remember and finish typing out tags.
- Copy the picture or video just by clicking it, and paste it where you want to send it. (Videos can only be pasted on the computer)
- Can keep the window always on top, for ease of just dragging and dropping from Chrome.
- Able to export and import the database, so as to not lose the saved entries.
